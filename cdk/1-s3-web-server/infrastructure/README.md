# Welcome to your CDK JavaScript project!

This is an example app using an S3 bucket as web server.

## Todos
add https://github.com/mobileposse/auto-delete-bucket (currently, cdk destroy always fails)

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app. The build step is not required when using JavaScript.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run test`         perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`           deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`             compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`            emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
