# Welcome to your CDK JavaScript project!

Very simple example of a AWS Lambda, inspired by https://cdkworkshop.com/20-typescript/30-hello-cdk/200-lambda.html.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app. The build step is not required when using JavaScript.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run test`         perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`           deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`             compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`            emits the synthesized CloudFormation template


`cdk deploy --outputs-file metadata.json --require-approval never`
